Add to the frontend a way to start a duel with another player.

Rewrite match.py in Go. Also figure out how it's going to display.

Add kicks (guard breaks)?
 Kick: Deals 1 damage if it isn't blocked, but can be dodged. What does it do if they block? No stun. Hm... maybe it stuns but they can press a button to get un-stunned.

Should dodging leave you in a backstepped state for a second?
